# Package ZLLM_CLIENT_OPENAI

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package implements a modular integration framework for OpenAI's Large Language Model (LLM) services. It provides a structured approach to handle API communication with OpenAI's endpoints through specialized client handling and JSON schema management. The package follows object-oriented design principles with inheritance to separate generic LLM functionality from OpenAI-specific implementations, making it extensible for other LLM providers while maintaining consistent interfaces.

The architecture ensures clean separation between communication layers, data transformation, and business logic, with dedicated components handling authentication, request formatting, and response processing specifically tailored for OpenAI's API requirements.
