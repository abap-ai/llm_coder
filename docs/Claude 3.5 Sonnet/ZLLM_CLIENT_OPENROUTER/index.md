# Package ZLLM_CLIENT_OPENROUTER

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package implements a specialized Large Language Model (LLM) client integration for the OpenRouter service. It provides a structured way to communicate with OpenRouter's API through HTTP, handling authentication, request formatting, and response processing. The package follows a layered architecture with base functionality inheritance and includes strict JSON schema validation for reliable data exchange. The implementation enables SAP systems to leverage various LLM models through OpenRouter's unified API interface while maintaining proper data structures and communication protocols.

The solution is designed to be maintainable and extensible, separating concerns between client communication, data structure handling, and schema validation. It integrates with SAP's standard HTTP client infrastructure while adding LLM-specific functionality for OpenRouter's requirements.
