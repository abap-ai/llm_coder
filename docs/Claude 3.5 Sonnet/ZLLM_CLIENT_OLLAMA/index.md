# Package ZLLM_CLIENT_OLLAMA

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package provides a comprehensive framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SAP systems, with a primary focus on Ollama LLM services. It implements a modular client architecture that handles the complete communication lifecycle between SAP and LLM services.

The package abstracts the complexity of LLM interactions through a clean interface design, managing HTTP communication, request/response formatting, and specialized message processing. It includes robust error handling and supports both synchronous and asynchronous processing modes.

Key capabilities include:

- Flexible client implementation for different LLM providers
- Standardized message handling and formatting
- Built-in support for tool calls and function execution
- Configurable authentication mechanisms
- Structured response parsing and processing

The architecture follows SOLID principles and allows for easy extension to support additional LLM providers while maintaining a consistent interface for SAP applications consuming LLM services.
