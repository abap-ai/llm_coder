# Package ZLLM_CLIENT_AZUREOAI

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package implements a comprehensive integration layer for Azure OpenAI services, enabling SAP systems to interact with Azure's AI capabilities. It provides a structured framework for handling AI requests and responses through Azure's API endpoints, with specialized components for authentication, JSON schema management, and communication protocols. The package is designed with a modular architecture that separates client communication from data structure handling, making it maintainable and extensible for different Azure OpenAI service interactions.

The implementation follows SAP's object-oriented patterns and encapsulates all Azure-specific logic while providing a clean interface for consuming applications. It handles the technical complexities of Azure OpenAI integration, allowing SAP developers to focus on business logic rather than API implementation details.
