AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package provides a comprehensive framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SAP systems. It follows a modular design pattern with a provider-agnostic core that supports multiple LLM services through specialized client implementations.

The framework offers:

- Standardized client interfaces for LLM communication with built-in support for chat completions and tool execution
- Secure provider configuration management with encrypted credentials
- Flexible authentication and authorization controls
- Comprehensive logging and statistics collection
- Template processing capabilities for dynamic text generation
- Structured output handling with JSON schema support
- Built-in tool implementations for common operations
- Error handling through specialized exception classes

The architecture enables easy extension through client packages for different LLM providers (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, OpenRouter) while maintaining consistent interfaces and security standards. The implementation emphasizes maintainability, security, and enterprise-grade features like logging and monitoring.

The framework is designed to be configuration-driven, allowing administrators to manage provider settings through a dedicated maintenance interface while developers can utilize a clean API for LLM interactions in their applications.
