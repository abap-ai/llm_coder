# Class ZCL_LLM_CALL_LOGGER

AI Generated documentation.
## Overview
The `ZCL_LLM_CALL_LOGGER` class implements the `ZIF_LLM_CALL_LOGGER` interface and provides logging functionality for LLM (Large Language Model) calls. The class offers:

- Constructor that initializes the logging state based on system configuration
- Add method (via interface) to log LLM call entries
- Configurable logging activation based on system settings and user filters

Public methods:
- `CONSTRUCTOR`: Initializes the logger
- `ZIF_LLM_CALL_LOGGER~ADD`: Adds a log entry if logging is active

## Dependencies
- Database table `ZLLM_CALL_LOG`: Stores the actual log entries
- Database table `ZLLM_SYSTEM`: Contains system configuration for logging
- Interface `ZIF_LLM_CALL_LOGGER`: Defines the logging contract

## Details
The class implements a conditional logging mechanism with two main decision points:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Constructor] --> B{Check System Settings}
    B -->|save_calls = true| C{Check User Filter}
    B -->|save_calls = false| D[Set Inactive]
    C -->|Filter matches| E[Set Active]
    C -->|Filter fails| D
    
    F[Add Entry] --> G{Logger Active?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Insert Log Entry]
    G -->|No| I[Return]
```

Key implementation aspects:
- The logger's active state is determined once during instantiation
- User filtering supports wildcard (*) for all users or specific username matching
- Log entries are only written if the logger is active, providing performance optimization
- The implementation uses database tables for both configuration and storage
- The design follows a fail-fast pattern in the add method to minimize overhead when logging is disabled
