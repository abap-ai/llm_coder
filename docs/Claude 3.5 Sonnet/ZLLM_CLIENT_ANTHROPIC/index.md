# Package ZLLM_CLIENT_ANTHROPIC

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

This ABAP package provides a comprehensive framework for integrating Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities into SAP systems. It implements a modular architecture for connecting to various LLM providers, with initial support for Anthropic's Claude model.

The package follows a clean separation of concerns, offering:

- Abstract base components for LLM interactions
- Provider-specific implementations (currently Anthropic)
- Standardized message handling and response processing
- Configuration management for API settings
- Error handling and logging capabilities

The design allows for easy extension to support additional LLM providers while maintaining a consistent interface for SAP applications to leverage AI capabilities through standardized chat completion methods.
