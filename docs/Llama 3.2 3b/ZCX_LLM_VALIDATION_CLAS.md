# Class ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview

The `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class is a custom exception class that inherits from `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK`. It is designed to handle various validation errors that may occur during the execution of the application. The class has several constants that define different error messages and attributes, and it has four data members (`MV_ATTR1`, `MV_ATTR2`, `MV_ATTR3`, and `MV_ATTR4`) that store the values of the attributes.

The class has a single public method, `CONSTRUCTOR`, which is used to initialize the exception object. The constructor takes several optional parameters, including `TEXTID`, `ATTR1`, `ATTR2`, `ATTR3`, and `ATTR4`, which are used to set the values of the attributes.

## Dependencies

### Class Diagram

```mermaid
class ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION {
  +-- CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK
  +-- IF_T100_MESSAGE
}

class ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION {
  +-- constructor
  +-- if_t100_message
}

class ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION {
  +-- MV_ATTR1
  +-- MV_ATTR2
  +-- MV_ATTR3
  +-- MV_ATTR4
}
```

### Logic Flow

The `CONSTRUCTOR` method is called when an instance of the `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class is created. The method takes several optional parameters, which are used to set the values of the attributes (`MV_ATTR1`, `MV_ATTR2`, `MV_ATTR3`, and `MV_ATTR4`). If the `TEXTID` parameter is not provided, the method sets the `if_t100_message` attribute to the default value.

### Interaction with Foreign Objects

The `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class interacts with the following foreign objects:

* `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK`: The `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class inherits from `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK`, which is a built-in SAP exception class.
* `IF_T100_MESSAGE`: The `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class implements the `IF_T100_MESSAGE` interface, which is used to define the error messages and attributes.
* `MV_ATTR1`, `MV_ATTR2`, `MV_ATTR3`, and `MV_ATTR4`: These data members are used to store the values of the attributes, which are used to define the error messages and attributes.

### Expert Notes

The `ZCX_LLM_VALIDATION` class is designed to handle various validation errors that may occur during the execution of the application. The class has several constants that define different error messages and attributes, and it has four data members that store the values of the attributes. The class interacts with the `CX_DYNAMIC_CHECK` and `IF_T100_MESSAGE` classes, and it uses the `MV_ATTR1`, `MV_ATTR2`, `MV_ATTR3`, and `MV_ATTR4` data members to store the values of the attributes.
