# GenAI ABAP Documentation Showcase

This documentation shows a simple example of GenAI generated ABAP documentation focused on classes, interfaces, reports and function modules.
**PoC** this is a simple first showcase to give you an idea of what to do with the [LLM Client](https://github.com/abap-ai/llm_client).

Everyone has different documentation requirements. This showcase shows a relatively simple approach focusing on the most important aspects of those code objects. A more detailed documentation is possible but you should always ask yourself: Who reads this? Do we really need it? Should we spend additional money at that?

All top-level folders contain a documentation of the same llm client implementation using different models:

* Llama 3.2 3b - surprisingly good for a 3b model, low resource test model
* Claude 3.5 Haiku
* Claude 3.5 Sonnet - my personal favorite for ABAP coding
* Deepseek R1
* Mistral Small 3 - a 24b model
