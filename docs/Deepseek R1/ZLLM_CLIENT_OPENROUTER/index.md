## Overview  

This ABAP package provides a standardized integration framework for leveraging OpenRouter's LLM API within SAP systems. It combines secure API communication capabilities with strict JSON schema enforcement to ensure reliable AI-powered data exchange. The solution features encrypted credential management via BAdI-based decryption hooks, HTTP(S) request/response handling optimized for LLM interactions, and specialized schema wrappers that enforce structural compliance with SAP data requirements. The implementation emphasizes security through credential abstraction and technical robustness through typed response parsing while maintaining compatibility with SAP's integration patterns.
