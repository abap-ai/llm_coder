# Package ZLLM_CLIENT

AI Generated documentation.

## Overview  

This ABAP package provides a secure, extensible framework for integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into SAP systems. It enables standardized interaction with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, etc.) through encrypted communication, structured request/response handling, and centralized configuration management.

## Core Capabilities  

- **Multi-Provider Support**: Implements dedicated clients for major LLM APIs (OpenAI, Azure, Anthropic, OpenRouter) with provider-specific authentication and payload formatting  
- **Security Framework**: Integrates certificate-based encryption, authorization checks, and secure credential storage using SAP SSF/STRUST  
- **Structured AI Interactions**: Manages complex chat workflows with tool integration (calculator, echo), JSON schema validation, and template-based content generation  
- **Operational Control**: Configurable logging, usage statistics, and system-wide activation controls via central configuration tables  
- **Extensible Architecture**: Uses BAdIs and factory patterns for dynamic implementation swapping, enabling custom tools, encryption, and authorization scenarios  

## Technical Foundation  

- Abstract base classes for HTTP communication, response parsing, and client lifecycle management  
- JSON schema generation from ABAP structures with type validation  
- Lightweight template engine supporting conditional logic and loops  
- Pluggable components for encryption, logging, and statistics via standardized interfaces  
- Central exception handling with domain-specific error classes (HTTP, auth, validation)  

## Integration Features  

- CRUD operations for provider configurations with ALV-based maintenance  
- Support for streaming responses and asynchronous processing  
- Tool execution framework enabling LLMs to trigger ABAP logic  
- Dynamic client instantiation with model/provider relationship validation
